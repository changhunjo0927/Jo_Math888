# Welcome
This is a course project page for MATH 888: Causal inference (Topics in mathematical data science).

## About Me
I am a Ph. D. candidate in the department of Mathematics at University of Wisconsin-Madison.
My research interests lie in theoretical understanding of machine learning.
In specific, I have worked on matrix completion with graph side information, and data poisoning attacks on algorithmic fairness.
For the first topic, I fully characterized the optimal sample complexity required for reliable estimation and quantified the efficacy of graph side information under a highly general model.
For the second one, I found the lower and upper bounds on the minimum data perturbation, measured in total variation distance, required for successful poisoning attack against risk minimization with fairness constraints.

With my background, I would like to design practical machine learning models with theoretical performace guarantees.
I think understanding causality can greatly improve machine learning models, so I am interested in studying causal inference.

## HW 2
$x^2+y^2=z^2$
