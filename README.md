# Welcome
This is a course project page for MATH 888: Causal inference (Topics in mathematical data science).

## About Me
I am a Ph. D. candidate in the department of Mathematics at University of Wisconsin-Madison.
My research interests lie in theoretical understanding of machine learning.
In specific, I have worked on matrix completion with graph side information, and data poisoning attacks on algorithmic fairness.
For the first topic, I fully characterized the optimal sample complexity required for reliable estimation and quantified the efficacy of graph side information under a highly general model.
For the second one, I found the lower and upper bounds on the minimum data perturbation, measured in total variation distance, required for successful poisoning attack against risk minimization with fairness constraints.

With my background, I would like to design practical machine learning models with theoretical performace guarantees.
I think understanding causality can greatly improve machine learning models, so I am interested in studying causal inference.

## HW 2
#### Problem of interest
Mobile health interventions to people in their everyday life is available due to wearables and digital technology. The micro-randomized trial (MRT), where each individual is repeatedly randomized among multiple intervention options over the course of the trial, has been increasingly used to provide data to inform the construction of these interventions. In "Estimating Time-Varying Causal Excursion Effect in Mobile Health with Binary Outcomes, Qian et al. (2021)," the authors proposed the definition of causal excursion effect that can be used in primary aim analysis for MRTs with binary outcomes.
